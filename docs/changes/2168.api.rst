Migrate muon analysis into the ``ctapipe-process`` tool:

1. The former ``muon_reconstruction`` tool is dropped and all functionalities are transferred 
   into the ``ctapipe-process`` tool.

2. The ``process`` tool now has a ``write_muon_parameters`` flag which defaults to ``false``.
   Muons are only analyzed and written if the flag is set. Analyzing muons requires DL1b image 
   parameters so even if ``write_parameters`` is ``false`` and no parameters are present in the 
   ``EventSource`` those are computed. 

3. Two instances of ``QualityQuery``, ``MuonProcessor.ImageParameterQuery`` and ``MuonProcessor.RingQuery`` 
   are added to the muon analysis to either preselect images according to image parameters and 
   to select images according to the initial, geometrical ring fit for further processing. 
   Deselected events or those where the muon analysis fails are being returned and written 
   filled with ``NaN``s instead of being ignored.
   Base configure options for the muon analysis were added to the ``base_config.yaml``.

4. The ``DataWriter`` now writes the results of a muon analysis into ``/dl1/event/telescope/muon/tel_id``,
   given ``write_moun_parameters`` is set to ``true``.

5. Muon nodes were added to the ``HDF5EventSource``, the ``TableLoader`` and the ``ctapipe-merge`` tool.
