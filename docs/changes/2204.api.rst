CEP-002 has been implemented. This is a major API breaking change,
as the whole event container structure of ctapipe has been updated.

The main change is the inversion of the hierarchy of telescopes
and data levels.

Where e.g. before the data level came first and then below that
were mappings for each telescope:

.. code:: python

   event.dl1.tel[tel_id].parameters.hillas

will now become accessing first the telescope event,
and then the dl1 container inside:

.. code:: python

   event.tel[tel_id].dl1.parameters.hillas

Fore more details, see :ref:`cep-002`.
