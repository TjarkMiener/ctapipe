This adds a disp reconstruction including ``ctapipe-train-disp-reconstructor`` for training
two machine learning models and application of these models in ``ctapipe-apply-models``
and ``ctapipe-process``.
``DispContainer`` is added for storing the disp prediction.
Stereo predictions are done by taking a weighted average of the single telescope predictions.
