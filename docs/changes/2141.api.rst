Drop support for ``CameraFrame`` in ``ImageProcessor``

``ImageProcessor`` now only uses the ``TelescopeFrame`` to perform all image operations.
This also drops support for calculating the ``HillasParameters`` in ``CameraFrame``.

Reading files with DL1 parameters in ``CameraFrame`` is also no longer supported.
