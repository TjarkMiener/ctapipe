Use ``weakref.proxy(parent)`` in ``Component.__init__``.

Due to the configuration systems, children need to reference their parent(s).
When parents get out of scope, their children still hold the reference to them.
That means that python cannot garbage-collect the parents (which are Tools, most of the time).

This change uses weak-references (which do not increase the reference count),
which means parent-Tools can get garbage collected by python.

This decreases the memory consumption of the tests by roughly 50%.
