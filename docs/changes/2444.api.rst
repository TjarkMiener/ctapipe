Set ``disable=None`` by default in progress bar of tools
``ctapipe-process``, ``ctapipe-merge`` and ``ctapipe-apply-models```
This way, progress bar is shown by default when running the tools
in interective mode. However, when executing the tools in a 
non-interactive mode (non-tty), the progress bar is not displayed.

This is achieved by using a ``--disable-progress`` command line
option that defaults to `None`. It also allows the user disabling
the progress bar via command line. Previous ``--progress`` and
``--no-progress`` command line options are deprecated.
